Two simple but useful tools in corpus linguistics are concordance displays and ngram frequency lists.

## Concordance displays

The backbone of corpus linguistics is the concordance display, that is, seeing words in the contexts in which they are used. The function `concord()` produces such a display.

See `?concord` for details about the arguments.

## Ngram frequency lists

Ngram frequencies are also a huge part of corpus linguistics. The function `ngram_freq()` produces a frequency list of single words, bigrams, trigrams, or even larger ngrams, specified by the `num_wd` argument.

See `?ngram_freq` for details about the arguments.
